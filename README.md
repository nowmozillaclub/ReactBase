# ReactBase
All course files for the event ReactBase - a React Firebase App on Project Collaboration Platform!

## About the event
---
ReactBase is a React Firebase event. Here we will be creating a Project Collaboration Platform wherein a team can keep a track of their tasks and which person is assigned to it.
It also comes with a Statistics page for each Workspace, to get a graphical representation of the data to help everyone understand better.

Check out the final build over [here](https://now-event-project-collab.web.app/)

## Instructions

- For each day of the event, a new branch will be created
  - For example: `Day 2(React-Basics)`
  - So that, if you missed any day's explanation then you can quickly come to this repository and check it out!
  
- After switching to a new branch, you are expected to read the `README.md` file first and then continuing with the source files.
